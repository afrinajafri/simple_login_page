# PHP-Login

PHP-based system to register, login, logout and change password.

## How it works

* The system is coded 100% in PHP (although a minimal knowledge of HTML is required). 
* There are four main pages: 
`register.php` for register a new user, 
`login.php` shows the login form, 
`welcome.php` shows the index of page,
`reset-password.php` to reset new password,
`logout.php` simply ends the session.

## How to use it

1. Download the source files to your computer.
2. Copy `demo.sql` into your PHPMyAdmin.
3. Open `http://localhost/simple_login_page/register.php` to run the system.
